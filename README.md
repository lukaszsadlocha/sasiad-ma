# üè° Sasiad-Ma  
**"SƒÖsiad Ma" ‚Äì An application to strengthen neighborhood bonds**  

This is a community-driven application designed to improve neighborhood relationships by **borrowing and lending useful items for free**.  

The idea is simple:  
- Sometimes you need an item only once or twice a year ‚Äì like a stroller when going on vacation with your baby. Instead of buying it, you could borrow it from your neighbor.  
- Other times, you want to work in your garden but realize you don‚Äôt own a shovel. Instead of purchasing one, you could borrow it from someone in your street or block.  

The goal is to **make borrowing and lending easy, free, and community-focused**, encouraging stronger connections between neighbors.

## üèó Architecture  
The first release will be a **simple monolithic application**:  
- **Back-end**: .NET (Minimal API, Domain-Driven Design principles, Result pattern)  
- **Front-end**: React (designed to be easily portable to mobile)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Hosting**: Initially on Azure or other free cloud hosting solutions  

Planned architecture improvements as the project evolves:  
- Introduce **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** to separate reads/writes for scalability  
- Ensure clean separation of **Core Domain**, **Application**, and **Infrastructure** layers  
- Prefer **Value Objects** and **Aggregates** where it makes sense in the domain  
- Implement **Unit & Integration tests** early (xUnit + SpecFlow for BDD)  
- Future migration towards modular or microservices architecture if community size grows significantly
